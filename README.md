## About
Tetris is an electronic game very popular, developed by Alexey Pajitnov , Dmitry Pavlovsky and Vadim Gerasimov , and released in June of 1984 . Pajitnov and Pavlovsky were computer engineers at the Computer Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences and Vadim was a 16-year-old student.

Tetris was one of the Soviet Union's first successful export items and one of the first to be seen as a type of addiction. Reached a target audience unprecedented in the history of video games.

Alexey Pajitnov got to know the Pentamin√≥ puzzle and decided to create a virtual version of it for his computer Electronica 60 . He removed one of the blocks from the game and named it with the prefix four in Greek: Tetris. 

The game consists of stacking tetraminos that move down the screen so that they complete horizontal lines. When a line forms, it disintegrates, the upper layers descend, and the player gains points. When the pile of tiles reaches the top of the screen, the game ends.
